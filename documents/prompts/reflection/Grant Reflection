Using cursor AI for me has been a game-changer. It comes with its own challenges, and I have many complaints that Ill bring up later but overall it makes me a more efficient programmer. For this project in particular cursor was great since my react skills are fairly rusty, so using chat was great. Another element that I was impressed with was the collaborative element, while our current implementation is pretty straightforward, having cursor read my partner's code and summarizing it for me and help format my code to use similar styles for consistency is great. Now for the bad, the pro models already costing money per request is very annoying to me, it also seems like the non-pro models that I've used with great success in the past are not giving me the results I remember getting. I used 3.7 MAX a couple times and I was really expecting more from the model, for something so highly regarded that I have to pay extra for I couldn't really tell a huge difference between that and 4o.
